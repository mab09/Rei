Have you ever played "Ready Steady Bang" ?
Project Rei will be an intense match of rock x paper x scissors with the timing and double player mechanic of ready steady bang.
Picture this:
1. Two players playing on the same phone (or seperate), 
2. Their respective characters on either side of the screen like in Shadow Fight 2 (2d Side View)
3. Only three attacks, three buttons (Taka, Hebi, Tora).
4. These options are essentially rock paper scissors, Taka kills Hebi, Hebi kills Tora, Tora kills Taka.
5. If same attack, who wins depends on who swiped first
6. Too much delay, you die anyway.
7. You constantly tap buttons before the timer, your character loses his/her cool and takes a defensive but futile stance.
8. The "timer" I mentioned, will be 3-4 heartbeats and at the final one, things slightly slow down and the screen shakes/some camera effect or something.
9. Idea is, that both players have to essentially feel the moment, rely on instincts and experience the consequences
10. Also, if you haven't noticed it already, this is about samurai, doing a duel in a Japanese grassland at night, under the moon, with a sakura tree and its leaves blowing in the wind


Here are the key parts of development:
1. Environment: Trees, leaves, grass, winds, background, moon, ambient sounds
2. Game Mechanics: Rock, paper scissors with a timing mechanic, made with dummy characters
3. Characters:  we'll have multiple character models, essentially shadowlike figures but not too basic. also weapons
4. Animations: attack, death and victory animations
5. UI: Main menu, etc
6. Production: Android and iOS, optimizing it all for them
7. Publish: Appstore and Play store. No Ads, or atleast not the ones that ruin immersion.
